# go-mazes

This project implements the frontend and backend of generating and solving mazes as graphs in golang. Mazes are calculated locally, packaged into HTML, and displayed using a webserver.

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
- Random Walls
- DFS with random direction

## Maze Solving Algorithms:
- DFS (Multi-threaded)
- BFS (Single-threaded)
- BFS (Multi-threaded)

## Notes

Firefox seems to be better than Chrome at rendering the maze quickly.
